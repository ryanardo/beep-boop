# BEEP! BOOP!

**Beep! Boop! Hi there! If you give me a number, I'll give you some _siiiiilly_ results! Go ahead, give it a try!**

By: **Ryan G Ferris**

## DESCRIPTION

_If you give me a number, I'll display an array containing all of numbers, starting at 0 up until I reach the number you gave me! If any number in that array contains a 0 in it, I'll convert the number to "Beep!"; or if any number contains a 1 I'll replace it with a "Boop!"; and finally, if the number is divisible by 3 I'll replace it with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." Wow! Much fun! So Blast! Much authentic!_
